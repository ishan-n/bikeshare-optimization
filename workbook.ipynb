    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "In urban areas, bike-sharing systems have witnessed growing demand as a sustainable mode of transportation. The primary challenge facing these systems is the effective allocation of two types of bikes – standard and electric – across different stations to maximize profitability. Our analysis is driven by the objective of determining the optimal number of each type of bike to station at our chosen 10 Citibike stations in NYC. This includes addressing the disequilibrium between demand and supply during various periods, which places significant pressure on operational repositioning efforts. By optimizing bike allocation, we aim to enhance operational efficiency and financial sustainability, considering both operational costs and potential revenues."

    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data Collection:\n",
    "To address our optimization problem, we combined datasets from Citibikes, nyc.gov, and Google Cloud Platform. The dataset encompasses two pivotal components: New York Citibike station data and Citibikes trips data. The former includes information on station capacity, empty docks, available bikes, and disabled bikes, while the latter provides detailed insights into each customer's bike trip.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data Preparation:\n",
    "Ensuring the accuracy and completeness of our data by filling gaps, and integrating different datasets into a unified format. Using statistical and visual tools to identify bike usage trends, patterns, and outliers in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Model 1:\n",
    "Our approach involves two models to tackle the optimization problem. The first model is an assignment optimization model aimed at determining optimal demand numbers for revenue maximization at selected stations during the morning slot from 8 a.m. to 10 a.m.\n",
    "Feeding Values into Model 2:\n",
    "The optimal demand numbers derived from Model 1 guide us in understanding the morning bike requirements at each station, a critical input for our second optimization model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Model 2:\n",
    "Our second model is a max flow optimization problem. Here, we seek to identify the optimal path for moving bikes overnight from one station to another at minimal cost. Each station can either supply bikes or may require additional bikes to meet the optimal demand in the morning.\n",
    "By structuring our methodology in this manner, we aim to streamline the optimization process, maximizing the efficiency of Citibike operations while minimizing associated costs.\n"

    "## Reason for Undertaking\n",
    "\n",
    "This endeavor aims to streamline resource utilization, reduce wastage, and ultimately enhance profitability by aligning bike supply with user demand. The successful execution of this project has the potential to yield several substantial benefits, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Enhanced Customer Satisfaction: By ensuring that each station has an adequate number of bikes to meet demand, we aim to provide a superior experience to our users, minimizing unmet requests and enhancing overall satisfaction.\n",
    "- Asset Optimization: Efficient allocation of bikes translates to optimized asset utilization. This approach minimizes the financial impact of idle or underutilized bikes while maximizing their use.\n",
    "- Improved Financial Performance: An optimized allocation strategy is expected to positively impact the company's financial performance. By reducing operational costs and enhancing revenues, the company gains financially.\n",
    "\n",
    "The outcomes of this model will determine the ideal number of bikes to be docked at each of the selected stations. The responsibility of implementing these recommendations will be assigned to designated personnel, called 'bike angels.'\n"

    "### **Identifying the most popular stations for Resource Allocation** :\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This segment is dedicated to pinpointing the pivotal hubs within our bike-sharing network. We concentrate on the influx of departures during peak urban transit times, specifically from 8 am to 10 am. This window captures the quintessential rush hour, providing us with a rich dataset to analyze user patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our methodology entails a thorough examination of trip frequencies across all stations during the specified morning rush period. We’ll then distill this data into a daily average, representing the typical demand throughout October 2023. This approach ensures that our demand figures are not skewed by outliers or one-off events but are instead reflective of consistent user behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure city-wide service optimization, our selection criteria for top-tier stations will hinge on two pivotal factors: the average demand and strategic geographic distribution. By doing so, we aim to encompass a wide array of urban territories, guaranteeing that our resources are not just concentrated in high-traffic areas but are also accessible to a broader demographic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further, we will delve into the duration aspect, calculating the average trip length for bicycles commencing their journey from these high-demand stations. This metric will offer valuable insights into the temporal patterns of our users, enabling us to fine-tune our deployment strategy and enhance overall service efficiency."
