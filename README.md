# bikeshare-optimization
This repository houses our project on optimizing the allocation of standard and electric bikes across 10 selected Citibike stations in New York City. Our goal is to enhance the operational efficiency and financial sustainability of urban bike-sharing systems by aligning bike supply with user demand, particularly during the morning rush hour.

**Problem Statement:**
In urban areas, bike-sharing systems have witnessed growing demand as a sustainable mode of transportation. The primary challenge facing these systems is the effective allocation of two types of bikes – standard and electric – across different stations to maximize profitability. Our analysis is driven by the objective of determining the optimal number of each type of bike to station at our chosen 10 Citibike stations in NYC. This includes addressing the disequilibrium between demand and supply during various periods, which places significant pressure on operational repositioning efforts. By optimizing bike allocation, we aim to enhance operational efficiency and financial sustainability, considering both operational costs and potential revenues.
