# bikeshare-optimization
This repository houses our project on optimizing the allocation of standard and electric bikes across 10 selected Citibike stations in New York City. Our goal is to enhance the operational efficiency and financial sustainability of urban bike-sharing systems by aligning bike supply with user demand, particularly during the morning rush hour.
